# Python Tutoring
This repo containing some examples from tutoring sessions with various students. Given the nature of certain assignments, I will, of course, keep certain details to a minimum so as not to accidentally dox a student. Each code sample will go into its own respective folder along with a description of the project/assignment. This includes things like Pipfiles (I like Pipenv!), so you can essentially think of each folder as its own mini-repo in a way.

I am doing this for multiple reasons:
- It keeps things more organized without compromising student anonymity (ex: organizing files via student name).
- It avoids having to worry about clashing dependencies (as different projects will have different needs).
- Each code sample is too small to warrant its own true repo.

I will try to add samples regularly.
